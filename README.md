# Bounce Messaging App

## Description
Our initial iteration of an online messaging app. Allows millennials to:
  *Register their username
  *Send and receive messages
 
## User Stories 
```

User sees the home page at the index where it has
A heading
A form
All the messages with a timestamp in reverse chronological order(newest at the top)

User can input text of a message

User can submit the form and see the new message at the top of the previous messages

User sees each message displayed on the home page abbreviated to 20 characters
User can click on each message of the list which takes me to a page which shows me the whole text of the message
for example a url could look like localhost:<port>/messages/2

your controller could match requests dynamically like
get ‘/messages/:id’ do
# how do you access the id from the request?
# and then what do you need to do?
end

Important:
Each Message will have to have an ID property that is unique.
